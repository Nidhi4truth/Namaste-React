Episode 5: Let's Get Hooked
============================

# There are two types of export
1. Default
2. Named

In a file we can have only one default export.
If you are using named export then at the time of import enclose the name of the file in curly brackets.
React is fast in DOM manipulation.

# React Hooks
Normal JS Utility functions given by React.
useState() -  Super powerful state variable
useEffect()

Whenever a state variable updates,React rerenders the component.

React makes the DOM manipulation fast.

# Reconiliation Algorithm / React Fiber (React 16)
res-conatiner has many restaurant cards ----> rc1,rc2,rc3,rc4,rc5,rc6,rc7.

After filtering we have to show only 3 cards ---> rc1,rc2 and rc3.

- Actual DOM is the tags.
- React creates a virtual dom.
- Virtual DOM is representation of actual dom.

- Diff Algorithm
Finds out the difference between updated and previous DOM.

When React finds out the difference between the updated and previous DOM, it actually rerenders the component.
